In this assignment you will get practice working with Java arrays, more practice implementing your own classes, and practice creating a procedural design in Java (in the BulgarianSolitaireSimulator class). Like you did in assignment 1 and lab 4, you will be implementing a class whose specification we have given you, in this case a class called SolitaireBoard, to represent the board configuration for a specific type of solitaire game described further below. You will also be using tools to help develop correct code, such as assert statements along with code to verify that your class implementation is consistent.
